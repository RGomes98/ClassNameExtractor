## Overview

CodeChisel is a lightweight tool designed to streamline the process of extracting class names from HTML, JSX, or JSX with CSS modules. The inspiration behind this project stems from the common developer struggle of manually copying and pasting class names from code snippets into a separate CSS file. CodeChisel simplifies this workflow, enhancing your development productivity by automating the extraction and organization of class names.

## Why CodeChisel?

As a developer, I frequently found myself spending unnecessary time copying class names from HTML or JSX files and pasting them into CSS files. This manual process not only drained my time but also introduced the potential for errors. CodeChisel was developed to address this pain point, providing a hassle-free solution for extracting and managing class names effortlessly.
